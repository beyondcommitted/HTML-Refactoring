# HTML-Refactoring
```
I was able to go in and consoldiate some of the CSS.
There were some redundancies that fit with other selectors.
Also, semantics of the tags helped in the process of refactoring.

## Meeting the Acceptance Criteria
```
Web page meets accessibility standards
I viewed the source code
and replaced semantic HTML elements
I viewed the structure of the HTML elements
and made sure that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
I viewed the image elements
I added accessible alt attributes
I viewed the heading attributes
made sure they fall in sequential order
I viewed the title element
made sure a concise, descriptive title can be read.

```

## Mock-Up
Here is a screenshot of the Web Application after the updates have been made to the code:
